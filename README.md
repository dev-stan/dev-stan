# Something about me

- I'm currently trying to master the Java and C languages.
- I enjoy to Windsurf in my free time, it's also my job!
- I'm the owner and creator of quite a big minecraft server (`medieval-vanilla.com`).

I made this github account to keep track of my projects, my goal is to commit a change at least once a day. The main languages I code in are Python and Java, I started learning python around 3 years ago and my adventures with Java (the most beaituful language) started very recently, around December 2020.
